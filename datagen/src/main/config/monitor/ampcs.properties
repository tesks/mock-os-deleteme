# This is an AMPCS properties file containing MultiMission  
# dictionary properties needed by the datagen product.
#
# This is the dictionary properties file for the older station 
# monitor dictionaries.  Only applies to channel files.
#
# This file is loaded using the standard AMPCS configuration file search
# mechanism, which typically looks first at the AMPCS system configuration 
# level, then at the project/mission configuration level, then at the user 
# configuration level. All properties files that are found will be loaded 
# in this order, with any configuration properties specified in later files 
# overriding those found in earlier files. It is not necessary to override
# all properties at the project or user level. If properties are omitted
# at any level, the property values loaded at the previous level remain in
# effect.
#
# Properties and their corresponding values must be included on a single line.
#
# Initial version supplied for MPCS-6641 (M.DeMore - 9/18/14)
#
# This parser is for the old MPCS/AMPCS monitor channel schema
