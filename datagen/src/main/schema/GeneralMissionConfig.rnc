# AMPCS General Data Generator Mission Configuration Schema
#
# This schema defines the XML used to configure a mission for the
# AMPCS data generator. This schema is used in cases where the
# mission configuration is minimal. More complex capabilities
# have their own mission configuration schemas.
#
# Version 1.0 - M. DeMore (MPCS-6854 - 11/21/14)
# Version 1.1 - M. DeMore change comments about defaults for SCLK
#               elements. Added packet header class element 
#               (MPCS-7663 - 9/10/15)
