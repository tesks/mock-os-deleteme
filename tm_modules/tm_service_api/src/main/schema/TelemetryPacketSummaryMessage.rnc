#
# AMPCS TelemetryPacketSummaryMessage RelaxNG Compact format XML specification.
#
# TelemetryPacketSummaryMessage is issued periodically by the packet extraction 
# in the downlink processor to provide a summary of packet extraction statistics 
# accumulated during the current session. It is possible that these numbers will
# suffer rollover if a session runs long enough.
#
# Version: 6.0
#
# ChangeLog: V5.0 3/14/2013 Updated to import new common session schema.
# ChangeLog: V5.1 3/14/2013 Updated to add station packet count
# ChangeLog: V6.0 5/18/17 Major updates for AMPCS R8
