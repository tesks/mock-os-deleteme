// end::header[]

// tag::purpose[]
This document describes the RESTful Monitor & Control (M&C) Interface to the AMPCS R8 Telemetry Ingester (TI) application. This interface can be used to interact with a running TI instance in order to obtain its status, control telemetry flow, get processing statistics, or shut the process down. This SIS describes only the M&C interface to the TI. It does not attempt to document the functional aspects of telemetry processing itself, only how this downlink application may be remotely controlled through a RESTful interface.

== Environment
=== Hardware Characteristics and Limitations
No specific hardware is required for use of the interface described by this SIS.

=== Interface Medium and Characteristics
The interface medium is HTTP or HTTPS over ethernet.  The API is implemented as stateless 
HTTP(S) GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests. When used over HTTP, exchanges are plain text.  When used
over HTTPS, the transport is encrypted.

=== Standards and Protocols
The M&C interface to the Telemetry Ingester application uses a Representational State Transfer (RESTful) interface, a widely used internet standard approach. The interface provides HTTP(S) requests to control process behavior and report process state. The specific HTTP requests available are documented later in <<Resources>> section of this document. The data structures used are documented later in the <<Definitions>> section of this document.

When content is returned in response to requests, it is expressed in standard JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

=== Software Initialization
There is no required software initialization to use the HTTP RESTful interface.  A basic unix "curl" command is adequate. The URI scheme is shown below.  The host on which chill_telem_ingest is running must be substituted for _<current downlink host>_. In the URIs for the specific <<Resources>> listed later in this document, the base path is included.

[%hardbreaks]
__Host__ : <current downlink host>
__BasePath__ : /ingest
__Schemes__ : HTTP, HTTPS

To make an HTTPS connection, you must be set up to use secure transport.  This means you must have a keystore in place. For more information about configuring secure HTTPS services with AMPCS, refer to the _AMPCS Adaptation Guide for Customers_.
