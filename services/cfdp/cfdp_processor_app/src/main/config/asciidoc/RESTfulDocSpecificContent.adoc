== Environment
=== Hardware Characteristics and Limitations
No specific hardware is required for use of the interface described by this SIS.

=== Interface Medium and Characteristics
The interface medium for the RESTful API is HTTP or HTTPS over ethernet.  When used over HTTP, exchanges are plain text.  When used
over HTTPS, the transport is encrypted.

The interface medium for receiving CFDP messages from the Java Messaging Service is TCP/IP.  Clients must use a JMS API mpdule specific to their programming language to access JMS.

CFDP-generated files, and files the user supplies to the CFDP processor, reside on a standard Unix file system. That is the interface medium.

=== Standards and Protocols
The monitor and control interface to AMPCS CFDP uses a Representational State Transfer (RESTful) API which is implemented with HTTP(S) GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests to control the behavior and query state information. The specific commands available are documented later in <<Resources>> section of this document.

AMPCS CFDP both reads and writes files from/to the filesystem on which the CFDP Processor executes. Some of these files can be exchanged with external software. The files that belong to that category include the data files to be sent to a remote CFDP entity, data files received from a remote CFDP entity, and metadata files (or transaction logs) that CFDP Processor generates as a result of uplink and downlink CFDP transactions.

AMPCS CFDP also publishes messages to a Java Messaging Service (JMS) that may be consumed by external software. The version of the JMS API supported by AMPCS is 1.1.

=== Software Initialization
There is no required software initialization to use the HTTP RESTful interface.  A basic unix "curl" command is adequate. The URI scheme is shown below.  The host on which the CFDP processor is running must be substituted for _<current CFDP host>_. In the URIs for the specific <<Resources>> listed later in this document, the base path is included.

[%hardbreaks]
__Host__ : <current CFDP host>
__BasePath__ : /cfdp
__Schemes__ : HTTP, HTTPS

To make an HTTPS connection, you must be set up to use secure transport.  This means you must have a keystore in place. For more information about configuring secure HTTPS services with AMPCS, refer to the _AMPCS Adaptation Guide for Customers_. 

To use the JMS interface, a client must know the network location (host and port) of the JMS broker and the subscription topics on which their CFDP instance is publishing.  Publication topics vary based upon configuration and are described in the AMPCS User's Guide. Generally, the Java Naming and Directory service (JNDI) is used to locate and attach to the JMS broker.

=== CFDP Data File Format

There is no particular format that AMPCS CFDP requires for data files. The purpose of CFDP itself is to exchange arbitrary data files. Data files submitted to the AMPCS CFDP Processor via *Put* requests will be sent as-is. Similarly, data files received from remote entities will be saved to the local file system just as it was received.

=== CFDP Data File Locations

AMPCS CFDP allows the user to configure the top-level directories for the data files.

==== Finished Downlink Files

The *cfdp.processor.finished.downlink.files.top.level.directory* configuration property in the AMPCS CFDP configuration file specifies the top level directory under which the downlink data files will be saved. If the downlink file transfer transaction specifies a destination file name of _/path1/path2/file_name_, then the effective path of the downlink data file that CFDP Processor generates will be _/<finished_downlink_files_top_level_directory>/path1/path2/file_name_.

If there is any name clashing, for example, two or more downlink file transfer transactions specify the destination file name of _/path1/path2/file_name_, the second file that is generated will have a _.1_ appended to its file name, the third will have a _.2_ appended to its file name, and so forth. AMPCS CFDP will not overwrite any files.

==== Active Downlink Files

The *cfdp.processor.active.downlink.files.top.level.directory* configuration property in the AMPCS CFDP configuration file specifies the top level directory under which the downlink data files for active transactions will be saved. The file name will also be appended with a timestamp. If the downlink file transfer transaction specifies a destination file name of _/path1/path2/file_name_ and the UTC time at which the file is generated is February 1, 2019, 8:00 AM, then the effective path of the downlink data file that CFDP Processor generates will be _/<active_downlink_files_top_level_directory>/path1/path2/file_name.20190201T080000_.

==== Downlink Files with Unknown Destination File Names

The *cfdp.processor.unknown.destination.filename.downlink.files.subdirectory* configuration property in the AMPCS CFDP configuration file specifies the subdirectory under which the downlink data files for transactions with unknown destination file names will be saved. The file name will be created for the file, which will be a concatenation of the downlink file transfer transaction's
(1) source entity ID, (2) transaction sequence number, (3) transaction start time, and (4) destination entity ID, all delimited by a '_-_' character. Example:  _/<finished_downlink_files_top_level_directory>/<unknown_destination_filename_downlink_files_subdirectory>/1-944302-20190511T120025-0_

==== Uplink Files

The *cfdp.processor.uplink.files.top.level.directory* configuration property in the AMPCS CFDP configuration file specifies the top level directory under which the CFDP Processor will look for the uplink data files. If the uplink file transfer transaction specifies a source file name of _/path1/path2/file_name_, then the effective path of the uplink data file that CFDP Processor will look for will be _/<uplink_files_top_level_directory>/path1/path2/file_name_.

=== Downlink File Metadata Files

When AMPCS CFDP generates a downlink file, it will also generate a downlink file metadata file in the same directory as the data file, with an identical file name plus the _.md_ file extension. This metadata file contains pertinent information about the CFDP transaction that generated the data file, as well as useful accountability information. The metadata file is in the https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23095_01/Platform.93/ATGProgGuide/html/s0204propertiesfileformat01.html[Java Properties File Format].

Following table lists the property keys that are found in the downlink file metadata files. Some keys are self-explanatory, and their description is left blank in the table.

.Downlink File Metadata File Property Keys
|===
|Property Key |Description
|delivery.file.generation.time |UTC
|destination.entity.id |
|destination.file.name |Destination file name specified in the Metadata PDU
|downlink.file.actual |Actual file location at which the generated file was saved

=== Uplink File Metadata Files

When AMPCS CFDP finished sending an uplink file, it will generate an uplink file metadata file in the same directory as the source data file, with an identical file name plus the _.md_ file extension. This metadata file contains pertinent information about the CFDP transaction used to send the data file to a remote entity, as well as useful accountability information. The metadata file is in the https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23095_01/Platform.93/ATGProgGuide/html/s0204propertiesfileformat01.html[Java Properties File Format].

If the same uplink data file is sent more than once, then the resulting (second) uplink file metadata file will have its file name appended with _.1_, the next resulting (third) uplink file metadata file will have its file name appended with _.2_, and so forth. AMPCS CFDP will not overwrite existing uplink file metadata files.

Following table lists the property keys that are found in the uplink file metadata files. Some keys are self-explanatory, and their description is left blank in the table.

AMPCS CFDP publishes real-time messages via the AMPCS Message Service, which uses JMS, for consumption by external software.

=== CFDP Message Topic

AMPCS CFDP publishes messages to the *cfdp* subtopic of AMPCS family of JMS topics. The absolute topic name varies upon the mission, venue, host, user, and other properties. (See https://mgss.jpl.nasa.gov/dms/sites/default/files/14046-Finalized1517505273.pdf[D-002001 AMPCS JMS Message SIS for Release 8+].) For example, in a _TESTSET_ venue, the top-level AMPCS topic name may be:

....
topic mpcs.generic.host.user
....

In this case, the subtopic to which AMPCS CFDP publishes messages to is:

....
topic mpcs.generic.host.user.cfdp
....

=== CFDP Message Types

AMPCS CFDP publishes 7 different types of messages as shown in the table below.

.CFDP Message Types
|===
|Type |Description
|CFDP Indication |Published when there is a CFDP Indication event. (CFDP Indications are defined in the https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/727x0b4.pdf[CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP), Blue Book, Issue 4, January 2007.])
|CFDP File Generation |Published when a downlink file is generated
|CFDP File Uplink Finished |Published when AMPCS CFDP finishes sending an uplink file
|CFDP File Request Received |Published when AMPCS CFDP receives a user request via its REST API
|CFDP File Request Result |Published after AMPCS CFDP acts upon a received user request to publicize the request's results
|CFDP PDU Received |Published when AMPCS CFDP receives a PDU
|CFDP PDU Sent |Published when AMPCS CFDP sends a PDU
|===
