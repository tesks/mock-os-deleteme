# AMPCS Session Config File Schema
# 
# This schema defines the SessionConfig.xml file. This is
# the file format written when a user invokes "Save Config" from the
# Session Configuration GUI windows in AMPCS GUIs, and is also
# the interchange format between AMPCS applications running
# in an integrated configuration and between AMPCS Java applications
# and MTAK. The XML file matching this schema can be passed to
# any AMPCS application or script that supports a --testConfig
# command line option.
