# This is the AMPCS properties file for the performance classes.
#
# This file is loaded using the standard AMPCS configuration file search
# mechanism, which typically looks first at the AMPCS system configuration 
# level, then at the project/mission configuration level, then at the user 
# configuration level. All properties files that are found will be loaded 
# in this order, with any configuration properties specified in later files 
# overriding those found in earlier files. It is not necessary to override
# all properties at the project or user level. If properties are omitted
# at any level, the property values loaded at the previous level remain in
# effect.
#
# Properties and their corresponding values must be included on a single line.

performance.categoryDescription=The performance properties dictate the operation of the performance status objects, specifically how often they are updated and when their current remaining capaicity is considered in yellow/alert or red/warning status. Heap refers to the heap memory and is montiored even when AMPCS has been opened, but not started. Bounded queue are all other monitored queues, heaps, buffers, etc.

performance.boundedQueueYellowLevel.description=Default YELLOW level (percentage) for bounded queues, percentage.
performance.boundedQueueYellowLevel.behavioralNotes=Used for bounded queues which do not have more specific performance-related properties in other locations. A value of 0 will disable the YELLOW health state.
performance.boundedQueueYellowLevel.validValues=0 to 100
performance.boundedQueueYellowLevel=80

performance.boundedQueueRedLevel.description=Default RED level (percentage) for bounded queues, percentage.
performance.boundedQueueRedLevel.behavioralNotes=Used for bounded queues which do not have more specific performance-related properties in other locations. A value of 0 will disable the RED health state.
performance.boundedQueueRedLevel.validValues=[value of performance.boundedQueueYellowLevel] + 1 to 100
performance.boundedQueueRedLevel=100

performance.heapYellowLevel.description=Default YELLOW level for heap memory, as percentage. A value of 0 will disable the YELLOW health state.
performance.heapYellowLevel.behavioralNotes=A value of 0 will disable the YELLOW health state.
performance.heapYellowLevel.validValues=0 to 100
performance.heapYellowLevel=85

performance.heapRedLevel.description=Default RED level for heap memory, as percentage.
performance.heapRedLevel.behavioralNotes=A value of 0 will disable the RED health state.
performance.heapRedLevel.validValues=[value of performance.heapYellowLevel] + 1 to 100
performance.heapRedLevel=95

performance.summaryInterval.description=Time interval between performance summary messages during standard processing, in milliseconds
performance.summaryInterval.validValues=0 to 100
performance.summaryInterval.behavioralNotes=A value of 0 will disable issuance of performance summary messages during normal processing
performance.summaryInterval=10000

performance.summaryShutdownInterval.description=Time interval between performance summary messages during shutdown, in milliseconds
performance.summaryShutdownInterval.validValues=0 to 100
performance.summaryShutdownInterval.behavioralNotes=A value of 0 will disable issuance of performance summary messages during shutdown
performance.summaryShutdownInterval=3000
