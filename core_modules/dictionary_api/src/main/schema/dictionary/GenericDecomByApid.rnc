# Multimission Generic Decom APID-to-Decom-Map Schema
#
# This schema defines an XML lookup table for associating generic decom
# maps to their respective packet APIDs. Each APID-to-map association must
# have the APID number as the unique key, and the value is the name
# of the decom map XML file for that APID. Only the file name and not
# the path should be specified. AMPCS will look for the file in the
# same manner as it seeks for other dictionary and configuration files.
#
# Also a "general" map can be specified, for decommutating packets
# having APIDs not listed in the table. Another usage would be to use
# one map for all packets, in which case the "general" map should be
# the only decom map specified.
