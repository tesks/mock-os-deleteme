# Defines a decom map for application to telemetry.
# Represents an entry point for generic decommutation of some
# telemetry object such as a packet or data product.
# Only one decom map can be defined for such a file. See
# GenericDecomMapCollection.rnc for defining multiple, reusable
# decom maps in a single file.
